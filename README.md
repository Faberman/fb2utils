## github local copy

Because the [homepage](http://code.google.com/p/fb2utils/) is unavailable anymore.

Original author's note: (c) [Lankier](mailto:lankier@gmail.com).
Original license (the same GPLv3) is in [COPYING file](./COPYING).

The code requires [lxml](http://lxml.de/installation.html).

## MacOS installation

Common `python2 ./setup.py build && python2 ./setup.py install` will do the job.

But, you have to install [lxml](http://lxml.de/installation.html) -- read that page carefully!
If you use [brew](http://brew.sh/), then you may pefer usage of `pip install`.
